# SafeMate

**1st prize project for BMW hackathon Hack@Night in November 2017 at LMU Munich**

As the number of road accidents per year is increasing steadily we developed a prototype that gives BMW drivers decision support, protects them, and playfully improves their skills. The driver communicates with the assistant via voice in real-time. For now, the assistant is rather static and pretends to receive input like current speed, grip, road condition, and weather data.
